/* This problem is a variation of leetcode-416 - Subset problem.
Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that difference is equal to given difference.
nums = [3,2,1,4]
diff = 4

s2 = (sum of arra - diff)/2;
Solve same way like leetcode 416, but change sum.
